Data and code for our study on Lesser Treeshrew (Tupaia minor) taxonomy (Juman et al. 2022)

# Overview
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jmammal/gyac080" target="_blank">This study</a> focused on infraspecific taxonomy and ecogeographic patterns in Lesser Treeshrews (*Tupaia minor*) from Southeast Asia. I analyzed multivariate morphometric data from the skulls and hands of museum specimens to examine subspecies boundaries. We concluded that there is no osteological support for the four currently recognized subspecies.
